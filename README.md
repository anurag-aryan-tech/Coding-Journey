# 🚀 My Coding Journey

This repository documents my real learning process as a student exploring programming. I share what I study, what I build, and what I learn along the way.

## Focus Areas
- Python fundamentals and problem-solving
- Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
- Django basics for web development
- Git and GitHub for version control

## How I Use This Repo
- Notes from topics I study
- Small practice projects and experiments
- Checklists of concepts to learn next
- Honest reflections on what was hard and how I improved

## Near-term Learning Plans (realistic)
- Python: functions, modules, file I/O, OOP basics
- DSA: arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks and queues; practice simple problems
- Web: Django project setup, models, views, templates; build a basic CRUD app
- Tools: Git basics (clone, commit, branch, PR), working with GitHub issues

## Progress Log
I’ll keep adding dated entries with what I studied and built. No inflated numbers—just genuine progress.

## Values
- Consistency over speed
- Understanding over memorization
- Learning in public, with honesty
