## 🎆 What's This Repository?

I created this space to:
- 📖 **Share my learning notes** - Topics I study, concepts I grasp, and areas where I struggle
- 💻 **Build projects** - Small, practical experiments that help me apply what I learn
- 🔇 **Track progress** - Real milestones, not fake achievements
- 💮 **Reflect honestly** - What was difficult? What clicked? How did I overcome it?
- 🤝 **Connect with others** - If you're also learning, let's support each other!

## 🎣 Near-Term Learning Goals (Realistic!)

### Q1 2025 Targets 🌫️
- ✅ **Python**: Master OOP concepts & file handling
- ✅ **DSA**: Solve 50+ problems on arrays, strings, linked lists
- ✅ **Django**: Build a complete CRUD application
- ✅ **Projects**: 3 mini-projects integrating all skills

### Success Metrics 📊
- Consistent daily practice (80+ days/month)
- Understanding > Speed
- Quality documentation
- 2-3 working projects
- Helpful code reviews/feedback from community

---

## 📝 Progress Log

### Recent Updates
- **Nov 2025**: Focusing on Python fundamentals + starting DSA
- **Completed**: Basic Python syntax, control structures
- **Currently Exploring**: Functions, OOP basics
- **Next Focus**: Linked lists & basic sorting algorithms

> **No inflated numbers here** - Just honest progress tracking and real milestones!

## 💎 My Core Values

### 🌱 Consistency Over Speed
- Small daily progress adds up
- Slow learning is still learning
- Better to understand 80% deeply than 100% superficially

### 🤔 Understanding Over Memorization
- I ask "why" before "how"
- I implement concepts from scratch
- I explain concepts to solidify understanding

### 📞 Learning in Public
- Sharing my journey inspires others
- Public accountability keeps me focused
- My struggles might help someone else

### 🚀 Growth Mindset
- Mistakes are feedback, not failures
- Every setback is a setup for comeback
- "Not yet" instead of "Can't"
